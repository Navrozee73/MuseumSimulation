# MuseumSimulation

Run using MuseumRunner.java

This software acts as a simulation and database for a museum of visitors, exhibits and artifacts. 
A museum building, containing a storage space area, a display space area, and a date of origin, contains multiple exhibits, which themselves consist of multiple artifacts.
Each artifact contains a name, description, date of origin, value ($), space it inhabits (sq. ft.), and date of purchase by the museum.
Further, visistors can come to the museum, paying a specific fee depending on their age. Visitors can freely move between different artifacts.
Statistics of the daily ongoings of the museum can be accessed via the Statistics and Analytics menu, while the simulation can be altered and progressed (e.g moving forward in day) via the Simulation menu.
